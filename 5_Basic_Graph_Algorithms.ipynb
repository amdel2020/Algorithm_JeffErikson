    "4 - Whenever groups of pigeons gather, they instinctively establish a pecking order. For any pair of pigeons, one pigeon always pecks the other, driving it away from food or potential mates. The same pair of pigeons always chooses the same pecking order, even after years of separation, no matter what other pigeons are around. Surprisingly, the overall pecking order can contain cycles—for example, pigeon i pecks pigeon j, which pecks pigeon k, which pecks pigeon l, which pecks pigeon i.\n",

Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute a pecking order for the pigeons, as guaranteed by part (a).\n",
